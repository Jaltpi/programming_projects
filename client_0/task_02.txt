- CHRISTMAS SHOPPING MATH HELP

## Ticket Component ##

- LVL_0

##  Background Context  ##

- Our client is going on a huge shopping spree for the holidays, and needs plenty of wrapping paper,
  but they want to only buy the necessary because wrapping paper isn't cheap these days.

## Ticket Description ##

- Create a program that takes a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each present,
and calculate the total square footage of required wrapping paper.

Fortunately, every present can fit in a box (a perfect right rectangular prism), which makes calculating
the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier, implement the following formula into the program:
    - to find the surface area of the box, please use -> 2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l.
Our client also needs a little extra paper for each present to account proper wrapping:
    - the area of the smallest side.

## Assumptions/Dependencies ##
- Client Provides a sample of present dimensions for us to use.
- Developer understands the following topics:
    - Flow Control
    - Loops
    - Data Structures:
        - Lists
        - Tuples
    - Functions
    - Testing

## Acceptance Criteria ##

- All test cases are passing:
    - A present with dimensions 2x3x4 -> 58
    - A present with dimensions 1x1x10 - > 43
